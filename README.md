# Lab Information System

This project is developed as part of the **COMP333 - Database Management System** course. It is a comprehensive solution for managing medical laboratory operations, including the addition and management of patients, samples, tests, reports, and invoices.

## Key Feature: Bookmark System  

The **Bookmark Feature** allows users to easily save and access important items in the application.  

- Users can bookmark any object in the system, including **patients**, **samples**, **tests**, **reports**, and **invoices**.  
- Bookmarked items appear in a **dedicated dropdown menu** located in the top-right corner of the screen for quick access.  
- This feature helps users easily revisit items they plan to work on later.  

### Example Use Case:
If a user wants to edit a patientâ€™s information at a later date, they can bookmark the patient. When needed, they can simply select the patient from the bookmarks menu and proceed to edit or view the details. This functionality is similar to the "favorite video" feature in TikTok, offering convenience and ease of use.
